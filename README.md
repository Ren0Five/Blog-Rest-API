# ðŸ—ƒ Blog API
#### by Ren Ramos

a blog web service that provide REST API endpoints built in Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JDBC and MySQL.
This web app is to demonstrate Spring Boot and Spring Data JDBC capabilities to implement a back-end solution. This web app uses Maven as build tool.

#### Configurations
1. First you must have MySQL Server installed to your local machine. After installation, you have the option to install also the MySQL Workbench as User Interface.
2.  Next configure the __"application.properties"__ file from src/main/resources, to match your MySQL server credentials application.properties file:
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/[your database name]
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=[your mysql user password. blank is default]
spring.sql.init.mode=always
spring.sql.init.schema-locations=classpath:blogAccountsSchema.sql,classpath:blogsSchema.sql
```
3. Then run the class **"SpringBootBlogRestApiApplication.java"** which has the main method.
4. Then use postman or any REST client you want to test this web application. Thank you so much. Please use the sample requests I provided.
